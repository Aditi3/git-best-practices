# Git Best Practices

Motivation of this repo is to curate Git best practices at one place and to make more people aware about standards followed by industry. Especially one that involves collaboration with others, it is better to establish conventions to follow lest we shoot ourselves in the foot.

### 1. Make clean, single-purpose commits

A commit should be a wrapper for related changes. For example, fixing two different bugs should produce two separate commits. It is better to keep commits as small and focused as possible for many reasons, some of them includes:

- It makes it easier for other developers in the team to understand the changes, making code reviews more efficient
- If the commit has to be rolled back completely, it's far easier to do so
- Additionally, it helps you parse changes you've made using git log


### 2. Write meaningful commit messages



### 3. Commit early, commit often

### 4. Pull request norms
